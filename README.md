## timefly
A lightweight implementation of k-means timeseries clustering using soft-dtw 
distance measure on accelerated hardware.

depending on your hardware it can achieve more than a 250x speed up over 
non-accalerated impelmentations. 

## todo's:
- distance matrix batch computation
- barycenter averaging cuda implementation

## acknolwedgements:
- tslearn
- github to softdtw
